Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  DriverPass was a small startup that wanted to provide online educational content to new drivers and the ability for those users to book driving lessons online. They wanted a system that was capable of delivering those two things over the web. 

What did you do particularly well?

  I think My business requirements document was fairly good. It went into a lot of detail that wasn't covered in the course on things like where to store the db etc. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I think the class diagram in project 2 is a bit lacking. That said the whole idea wasn't really fleshed out enough to really make a proper class diagram. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I interpreted the users needs at face value when doing the system design. It was rather straightforward to see what their vision was and what steps were needed to implement those features. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I think gathering really good business requirements and then documenting use cases and desired outcomes is the way to go. In my job this is how I approach new stores or tasks when I receive them.
